Simple Sokoban is a (simple) Sokoban game aimed at playability and portability
across systems. It is written in ANSI C89, using SDL2 for user interactions.
I developed it primarily for Linux, but it should compile and work just fine
on virtually anything that has a C compiler and supports SDL2.

 Features:
  - animated movements,
  - unlimited level solutions,
  - unlimited undos,
  - 3 embedded level sets,
  - support for external *.xsb levels (possibly RLE compressed),
  - support for levels of size up to 62x62,
  - copying levels to clipboard,
  - save/load,
  - skins supports,
  - ...


=== EXTERNAL LEVEL FILES =====================================================

Simple Sokoban can load levels from external *.xsb files. There are two ways
to load such file: either pass it as a parameter on command line, or drop the
file to the Simple Sokoban application window. The second method will work
only if your windowing system supports it.

Simple Sokoban is also able to load gzipped xsb files (xsb.gz).


=== COMMAND-LINE PARAMETERS ==================================================

Simple Sokoban accepts some command-line parameters. If a parameter is not
part of the known list of parameters, then Simple Sokoban assumes it is the
path to a XSB level file.

--movspeed=n   player's moving speed: 1..100, 1=slowest 100=instant default=20
--rotspeed=n   player's rotation speed: 1..100, default=20
--skin=name    skin name to be used (default: antique3)
--skinlist     display the list of installed skins


=== SKINS SUPPORT ============================================================

Simple Sokoban is distributed with a few skins and uses the "antique3" skin by
default. Skin files can be located in the following directories:

 * a skins/ subdirectory in SimpleSok's user directory
 * a skins/ subdirectory in SimpleSok's application directory
 * a skins/ directory in the package configured data directory
 * /usr/share/simplesok/skins/

The skin format used by Simple Sokoban is a variation of a sprite map often
called "the common skin format". The format is explained in detail at on
the project's website: http://simplesok.sourceforge.net/skinfmt/


=== KEY BINDINGS =============================================================

Simple Sokoban is controlled via well-known keyboard keys that should be
intuitive:

  F1                - display help
  F2                - turn on/off graphical elements
  F3                - dump the level to clipboard
  F5/F7             - save/load game state
  Backspace         - undo last move / stops solution playback
  R                 - restart the ongoing level
  S                 - play the solution (available for solved levels only)
  CTRL+C            - copy current level state to clipboard
  CTRL+V            - paste moves from clipboard
  CTRL+UP/CTRL+DOWN - zoom in/out
  F11 or ALT+ENTER  - fullscreen on/off


=== BUILD INSTRUCTIONS =======================================================

- Create a distribution tarball from a vcs snapshot:

    $ svn checkout svn://svn.code.sf.net/p/simplesok/svn/trunk simplesok
    $ cd simplesok
    $ autoreconf -fi
    $ ./configure
    $ make dist-xz

  Then find the tarball simplesok-*.tar.xz in the current directory.

- Compile and run from a distribution tarball:

    Download, uncompress and untar
    $ cd simplesok-*
    $ ./configure <option> ...
    $ make
    $ ./simplesok

  where specific <option> can be:
  --disable-libcurl          Do not use the curl library to access
                             internet levels.
  --with-software-renderer   Do not use video graphics hardware acceleration.
  --with-pkgdatadir=<dir>    Package data file directory.

- Compile and system-wide install from a distribution tarball:

    Download, uncompress and untar
    $ cd simplesok-*
    $ ./configure <option> ...
    $ make
    $ sudo make install

- Building an rpm package from a distribution tarball

    Download, uncompress and untar
    Copy the tarball into your rpmbuild SOURCES directory
    $ cd simplesok-*
    $ ./configure
    Select the rpm specification that best fits your needs from one of the
      pkgbuild/rpm*/simplesok.spec files
    $ rpmbuild -ba <selected-spec-file>

  Then find the rpm source and binary packages in your rpmbuild directory tree.
